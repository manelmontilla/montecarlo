# Montecarlo simulation simple implementation

This repository contains a simple implementation of the
Montecarlo simulation used to estimate probabilities.

Two examples of estimations using Montecarlo simulation are provided:

* Probability of winning the craps game.
* Probability of two persons out of 50 having their birthday in the same
  day of the year.
